# Ringtones

Place ringtone files here if you want a custom ringtone.
Name suggestions:
- incoming.mp3
- incoming.ogg

If you add a file named `incoming.mp3`, the app will try to play it as a fallback if WebAudio is not available.

Short optimization tip: keep the file under 100KB for faster network delivery on mobile.
